# Cocktail-App


Prototype application(Portrait Mode Only) created for a school project in Android Studio. My goal with this project was to learn to use react api interactions, google Firebase, and junit testing. 

It is a simple cocktail app written in java using android studio, googles firebase(for user authentication and database storage), and cocktailDb API to search and favorite drinks.
Some of the features of this application allow the user to login or create an account to view the cocktail list.
Once logged in users can search and favorite cocktails along with edit personal information on their private account.
When a cocktail is clicked a new fragment appears that gives the user the drink name, ingredients , and directions on how to make the cocktail. 

Guidelines:
- Design and develop a fully functional software application that addresses your identified business problem or organizational need. Include each  of the following attributes as they are the minimum required elements  for the application:

- one of the following application types: mobile, web, or stand-alone application 
- code including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- search functionality with multiple row results and displays
- a database component with the functionality to securely add, modify, and delete the data
- ability to generate reports with multiple columns, multiple rows, date-time stamp, and title
- exception controls
- validation functionality
- industry appropriate security features
- design elements that make the application scalable
- a user-friendly, functional GUI
